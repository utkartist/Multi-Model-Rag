# Multi-Model-Rag
Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique that combines text and image data to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. This tutorial will guide you through the process of implementing a multimodal RAG system using GPT-4 and Llama Index.

Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model
## Overview
This project implements a Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which integrates information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. The model is capable of processing multiple modalities, such as text and images, to enhance its retrieval and generation capabilities.

Features
Multi-Modal Input Handling: Processes both text and images to retrieve relevant information.
Enhanced Retrieval Mechanism: Utilizes a sophisticated retrieval system to fetch contextually appropriate data.
Improved Text Generation: Leverages retrieved information to generate more accurate and relevant text outputs.
Extensible Architecture: Easily adaptable to different datasets and tasks.

## MULTI MODEL RAG FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES BASED ON TESLA CARS
This repository contains code demonstrating a multi-model retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach taking electric cars as an example, specifically focusing on Tesla cars.

# Multimodal RAG extends traditional text-based RAG by incorporating image data:

Indexing: Both text and images are processed and stored in separate vector stores.
Retrieval: When a query is received, relevant text and images are retrieved based on similarity.
Augmentation: The retrieved information is used to augment the input to the LLM.
Generation: The LLM generates a response based on the augmented input.

### Model Description
This project demonstrates how to use Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for electric vehicles, focusing on Tesla cars. It utilizes a vector database to store and index images, enabling efficient retrieval and generation of information based on visual data. The model processes these images to generate textual descriptions and answers questions related to the visual content.


### Inference
The inference process involves querying the vector database with images, retrieving relevant information, and using the Multimodal RAG model to generate coherent and informative responses. The model leverages both textual and visual data to enhance its understanding and generation capabilities.
