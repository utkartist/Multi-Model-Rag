# Multi-Model-Rag
Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique that combines text and image data to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. This tutorial will guide you through the process of implementing a multimodal RAG system using GPT-4 and Llama Index.

Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model
Overview
This project implements a Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which integrates information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. The model is capable of processing multiple modalities, such as text and images, to enhance its retrieval and generation capabilities.

Features
Multi-Modal Input Handling: Processes both text and images to retrieve relevant information.
Enhanced Retrieval Mechanism: Utilizes a sophisticated retrieval system to fetch contextually appropriate data.
Improved Text Generation: Leverages retrieved information to generate more accurate and relevant text outputs.
Extensible Architecture: Easily adaptable to different datasets and tasks.
